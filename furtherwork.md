There are many possible directions that could be explored with regards
to time-series RUL prediction. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
are one promising avenue of study, as they have been successfully
applied to time-series datasets in the past. CNNs operate by using a
kernel to perform a convolution operation in a hidden layer instead of
the usual matrix multiplication. Essentially, this abstracts the input
data to a feature map in a different space.

Other methods that have seen success with time-series data are random
forest, gradient boosting regressor, and time-delay neural
networks. Additionally, it might be interesting to examine how simpler
methods like polynomial or SVM regression compare to more complex
neural-network based models.

In summary, there are many machine learning frameworks that could be
useful with time-series data, and future work could compare these with
the methods explored in this study.
